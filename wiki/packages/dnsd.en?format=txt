== Example use case ==
I forward port 53 from outside to 10053, using [wiki:packages/avm-firewall AVM firewall CGI], where [wiki:packages/iodine iodine] runs. ''iodine'' forwards requests for unknown domains to port 5353 where ''dnsd'' runs. ''dnsd'' answers requests for just a few sub-domains I want to use too.
