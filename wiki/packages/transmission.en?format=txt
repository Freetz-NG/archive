== Blocklist ==
If you want to use a peer-blocklist (you can enable this in the web interface if you are using the trunk version of Freetz), you have to know that you have to provide a blocklist yourself. The simplest is to make a 'update-blocklist.sh' with the content below and to invoke it daily or so using cron (don't forget to make the file executable).

{{{
#!/var/tmp/sh

cd /path-to/bittorrent/config/blocklists/
if wget -q http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/level1.gz ; then
        rm -f level1 && gunzip level1.gz
        killall -HUP transmission-daemon
        logger -s -t transmission "blocklist updated"
else
        logger -s -t transmission "blocklist not updated"
fi
}}}
This can be done from the transmission web interface too now.

== Number of peers ==
It is probably a good idea to reduce the number of peers by editing the ''.../bittorrent/config/settings.json'' file:

{{{
    "peer-limit-global": 150,
    "peer-limit-per-torrent": 50,
}}}
You have to stop transmission before changing this! Or you could use this command to reload the config file:

{{{
killall -HUP transmission-daemon
}}}
This can be done from the transmission web interface too now.

== Memory usage ==
Huge, relatively.

You will probably need a swap file and you may want to increase [http://lwn.net/Articles/83588/ swappiness] to 80 or something (in Freetz WebIF since [6886]).

|| || '''!VmSize''' || '''VmRSS''' ||
|| No blocklist || ~8,5 mB || ~6 mB ||
|| level1 blocklist || ~17 mB || ~8 mB ||
|| One torrent + blocklist || ~19 mB || ~12 mB ||

You can monitor these values easily with the patch from ticket #1308.

== Limit memory usage ==
To prevent memory shortage (could cause reboots and crashing processes):

{{{
    "cache-size-mb": 1,
    "open-file-limit": 32,
}}}
The cache size is by default 2 MiB and the open file limit is by default 32.

To minimize the number of connections you could decide to forward TCP traffic only and not UDP traffic.

== Watchdog ==
It may be necessary to disable the watchdog by adding this line to for example ''rc.custom'':

{{{
    echo "disable">/dev/watchdog
}}}
