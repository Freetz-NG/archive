== Using with Tor ==
 1. Add ''socksParentProxy=localhost:9050'' to ''Additional options''
 1. Point your browser http proxy to 192.168.178.1:8123
 1. Set ''No proxy for'' to ''localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.178.0/24''

(assuming default configuration)

If you use Firefox, use [https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/2275/ Tor Button] to prevent DNS leakage (and other privacy problems with cookies, plugins, etc).

== Using at your office ==
Maybe your internet access at your office (school, internet caf√©, etc) is restricted, filtered and/or monitored and you don't want that. In my case Trend Micro !OfficeScan blocks a lot of web-sites as false positives (including [http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/ www.ip-phone-forum.de]). A solution is this:

 1. Install Polipo and [wiki:packages/dropbear dropbear] (or another tunnel package)
 1. Forward port 22 (and/or 80 if port 22 is blocked) to localhost:22 using [wiki:packages/avm-firewall AVM-firewall]
 1. Create an [http://oldsite.precedence.co.uk/nc/putty.html SSH tunnel] from your office to your Fritz!Box, for example using [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ putty]
 1. Configure your browser at your office to use the http proxy localhost:8123 (assuming default Polipo configuration)

It is not an bad idea to restrict the memory Polipo will use with the following additional option:

{{{
chunkHighMark=1048576
}}}
== Security ==
Unless you restrict the IP addresses that can access dropbear, my advice is to disable password login and to use [wiki:packages/dropbear#ZugangmitPutty1 host-based authentication].

It is also possible to encapsulate SSH traffic using [wiki:packages/stunnel STunnel], for cases where only http/https traffic is allowed.

Beware that DNS requests could still be monitored, see the section about Tor about how to prevent this. (it is possible to use Tor Button without Tor)

It is possible to tighten security by using these options:

{{{
tunnelAllowedPorts=443;allowedPorts=80,443
}}}
This prevent tunneling through the proxy and access to the freetz web interface.

== Blocking domains ==
Using the extra options it is possible to specify a file with forbidden domains, like this:

{{{
forbiddenFile=/var/media/ftp/uFlash/polipo/forbidden
}}}
Add the domains you want to block on separate lines, like this:

{{{
doubleclick.net
googleadservices.com
google-analytics.com
googlesyndication.com
facebook.com/plugins

}}}
