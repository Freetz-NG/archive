You might want to add this or similar to the extra configuration:
{{{
BanOnGarbage = 300
BanOnMaxPerIP = 60
BanOnMaxReqSize = 300
KickOnBan = yes
RebanDuringBan = yes
}}}
And you might want to limit the number of simultaneous connections too:
{{{
ConnectionsTotal = 5
ConnectionsPerIP = 3
}}}
