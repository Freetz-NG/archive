== Net-SNMP ==
Net-SNMP ('''S'''imple '''N'''etwork '''M'''anagement '''P'''rotocol) includes an open source SNMPd agent to monitor and administer SNMP capable network devices like routers and switches. [[br]]
You can poll the snmpd agent on the router to obtain e.g. interface or CPU statistics information and display this in a nice graph with the help of a program like [http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/ MRTG] [[br]]
More info about Net-SNMP can be found via: http://www.net-snmp.org/ [[br]]


=== Creating a Feetz Image with Net-SNMP ===

Follow the directions from the [http://freetz.org/wiki/WikiStart.en# Wiki] [[br]]
After the following step you can configure the packages you want to have included in your image.
{{{
make menuconfig
}}}

Make sure the following is selected (so I have 1 out of 3 selected):
{{{
Package selection  ---> Standard packages  ---> [*] Net-SNMP 5.4.2.1 snmpd
Package selection  ---> Standard packages  ---> [ ]   With openssl encryption (NEW)
Package selection  ---> Standard packages  ---> [ ]   With zlib compression (NEW)
}}}


=== Setup in Freetz web-interface ===

==== conf ====
First you should create a snmpd.conf file. This file contains all configuration options for Net-SNMP, including a community string, which you can regard as a password for access control. [[br]
A full description of all possible parameters can be found in the online manual page: http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpd.conf.html [[br]]
You can edit the snmpd.conf file via the Freetz web-interface via Net-SNMP > snmpd.conf [[br]]

If you would like to have a minimal config you can use the following:
{{{
rocommunity public
rwcommunity private
}}}

This way access contol is only based on the communiy string. [[br]]

I found an example config with more accss contol options in one of the attachments in this thread: http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=122073 [[br]]
This shows how to control access based on source IP address range with additional options to restrict access. [[br]]

{{{
##      sec.name  source          community
##      ========  ======          =========

access  MyROGroup    ""      any       noauth    exact  all      none   none
}}}

If you only allow access from inside your trusted network you can use the default community string, which is for readonly '''public''' and for readwrite '''private'''. [[br]]

==== setup ====
After saving a snmpd.conf file using the Net-SNMP > snmpd.conf setup page you can enable Net-SNMP to start automatically at bootup.[[br]]

[[Screenshot(246)]]


==== verify ====
With many Linux distributions you als have snmp tools included like snmpget, snmpset, snmpwalk, ...[[br]]
A quick guide how to use these tools can be found [http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials on the net-snmp.org site]. [[br]]

Some commands:
To get a list of interface descriptions (ifDesc):
 snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community string> 192.168.178.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2

 snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community string> -O a 192.168.178.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2

To get a list of all available objects:
 snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community string> 192.168.178.1 .1


== MRTG ==
The Multi Router Traffic Grapher will allow you to generate nice graphs of the data available via SNMP.[[br]]
This can be system information like uptime, interface information and statistics, and more.[[br]]
The graphs can help a lot with trouble clearing issues, both with the Frits!Box (e.g. CPU memory), and in the network.[[br]]
For more info see the [http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/ MRTG site].[[br]] [[br]]

Here an example on the graph you can generate: [[br]]
